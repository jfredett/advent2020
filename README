# Advent of Code 2020

This year, I'm going back to my roots, and writing a bunch of crappy Ruby
solutions.

Usually I try to learn a new language or solidify one I'm not comfortable in,
but this year, I'm trying a different constraint -- speed.

I want to try to solve these puzzles as _fast_ as possible. Even if that means
shitty looking code or hobbled together structures. You can see this in day1's
solution -- it's a thrown-together hash-of-arrays, but it took me about 20
minutes to go from absolutely nothing to complete.

After I've solved the puzzles, I'll go back and extract common ideas and try to
refactor my way towards something I don't hate.

Ultimately, this is an experiment in _extreme_ commitment to YAGNI / MVP and
refactoring. We'll see how it works out.
